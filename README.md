## Automation for book recomendations

---
### User story

Our customer loves buying books, but has terrible difficulty deciding which books to purchase. You want to help by
writing an application or a script that:
1. Will ask the user to select their preferred genre
2. Will fetch a random book for the selected genre from
https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-books-2020
3. Will then open a browser (Chrome for example), and
    - open Amazon.com
    - find the selected book on Amazon
    - add that book to the cart
    - display the checkout page

Now, the user just has to confirm the purchase and soon they will get to enjoy a new book to read!
